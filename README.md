Product Metrics Dashboard

This is an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit to visualize and analyze key product metrics for SaaS or product-driven businesses. The dashboard provides insights into user engagement, customer retention, and product success.

Features

	•	Date Range Filters for Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) to focus on specific time periods.
	•	Interactive Parameters allowing you to adjust churn and retention periods dynamically.
	•	Visualization of Key Metrics like Churn Rate, Retention Rate, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Feature Adoption Rate, and Net Promoter Score (NPS).

Setup and Running the Dashboard

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.7 or higher
	•	Streamlit and other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shashankborse/product-metrics-dashboard.git
cd product-metrics-dashboard


	2.	Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Running the Dashboard

	1.	Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run dashboard_app.py


	2.	Open the dashboard:
	•	After running the command above, Streamlit will provide a local URL (typically http://localhost:8501) that you can open in your browser to view the dashboard.

Example Data

The data/ directory contains example CSV files to simulate product metrics:

	•	login_data.csv: Contains login timestamps for calculating DAU and MAU.
	•	churn_data.csv: Last active dates for calculating churn.
	•	retention_data.csv: First active and return dates for calculating retention.
	•	purchase_data.csv: Purchase amounts and subscription dates for LTV.
	•	nps_data.csv: NPS scores for customer satisfaction.
	•	feature_usage.csv: Usage data for calculating Feature Adoption Rate.

You can replace these with your actual data files as needed.

Key Metrics Explained

	•	DAU and MAU: Tracks active users daily and monthly.
	•	Churn Rate: The percentage of users who stop using the product within a specified period.
	•	Retention Rate: Percentage of users retained within a defined timeframe.
	•	LTV: The average revenue generated by a user during their time using the product.
	•	CAC: The average cost of acquiring a single customer.
	•	Feature Adoption Rate: Percentage of active users who use a specific feature.
	•	NPS: Measures customer loyalty based on user recommendations.
